## P01 - Vector Class
### Ngoc Bao Tran Tran
### Description:

Vector is of the most useful and effective data structure in C++ STL. In this project, I am implementing a Linked List based Vector class with the help of professor Terry Griffin. <br>

The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with the concept of Object Oriented Programming. <br>

Most of the important functions are implemented in class List and then called in class Vector. <br>

### Files

|   #   | File            | Description                                                            |
| :---: | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | vector.cpp      | The main file that contains all functions prototype and implementation |
|   2   | input.dat       | File contain data for testing                                          |
|   3   | test.out        | File contain the output of the program                                 |

### Instructions

- Make sure you have g++ compiler installed on your machine
- First of all, you have to compile the program by typing the following command with two parameters as follow in the terminal:
```
g++ <source file name> -o <build file name>
```
- After compiling, run the program by typing the name of the file you have built previously:
```
./<build file name>
```

- Example Command:
  - ```g++ Vector.cpp -o Vector```
  - ```./Vector```
