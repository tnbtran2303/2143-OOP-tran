## P02 - Vector Class 
### Ngoc Bao Tran Tran
### Description:

Continue with the Vector class from the previous exercise. This time, we will implement the overloaded operators for the Vector class. The overloaded operators are:

- `+` : add two vectors
- `-` : subtract two vectors
- `*` : multiply two vectors
- `/` : divide two vectors
- `==` : check if two vectors are equal
- `[]`: access the element at the given index
- `<<` : print out the vector
- `=` : assign a vector to another one

|   1   | main.cpp | The main file that contains all functions prototype and implementation |
|   2   | output.txt   | File contain the output of the program                                 |

### Instructions

- Make sure you have g++ compiler installed on your machine
- First of all, you have to compile the program by typing the following command with two parameters as follow in the terminal:
```
g++ <source file name> -o <build file name>
```
- After compiling, run the program by typing the name of the file you have built previously:
```
./<build file name>
```

- Example Command:
  - ```g++ main.cpp -o Vector```
  - ```./Vector```
