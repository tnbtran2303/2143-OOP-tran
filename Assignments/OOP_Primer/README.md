## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> Data Abstraction is a process of providing only the essential details to the outside world and hiding the internal details, i.e., representing only the essential details in the program.

#### Attributes / Properties
> Attributes are one of the key features of modern C++ which allows the programmer to specify additional information to the compiler to enforce constraints(conditions), optimise certain pieces of code or do some specific code generation.

#### Class
> A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class

#### Class Variable

#### Composition
> A class can have one or more objects of other classes as members. A class is written in such a way that object of another existing class becomes a member of the new class. This interconnection between classes is known as C++ Composition

#### Constructor
> A constructor is a member function of a class that has the same name as the class name. It helps to initialize the object of a class. It can either accept the arguments or not. It is used to allocate the memory to an object of the class.

#### Encapsulation
>  Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them

#### Friends
> A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend.

#### Inheritance
> The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance
> <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/inheritance2.png">

#### Instance Variable
> Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor, or block.

#### Member Variable
> A member variable is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions).

#### Method
> Methods are functions that belongs to the class.

#### Multiple Inheritance
> Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one classes.
> <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/diamondproblem.png">

#### Object
> An Object is an instance of a Class

#### Overloading
> An overloaded declaration is a declaration that is declared with the same name as a previously declared declaration in the same scope, except that both declarations have different arguments and obviously different definition (implementation).

#### Polymorphism
> Polymorphism is the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 
> <img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/2/062920_1112_CPolymorphi1.png">

#### Public / Private / Protected
> public - members are accessible from outside the class
> private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
> protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

#### Static
> Inside a class definition, the keyword static declares members that are not bound to class instances.

#### Virtual
> A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.
